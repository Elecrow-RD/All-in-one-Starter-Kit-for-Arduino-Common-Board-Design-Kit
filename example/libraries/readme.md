### Adafruit_BusIO
AdafruitBusIO is a library for communicating with various hardware, providing support for buses such as I2C, SPI, and UART.

### Adafruit_LiquidCrystal
The AdafruitLiquidCrystal library allows you to easily control liquid crystal displays (LCDs), commonly used for displaying text and other information.

### Adafruit_MCP23017_Arduino_Library
This library enables Arduino to interact with the MCP23017 I/O expander chip, thereby adding additional GPIO pins.

### BH1750
The BH1750 library is used for reading data from the BH1750 ambient light sensor, which is a high-precision digital ambient light sensor.

### DHT20
The DHT20 library is used for obtaining temperature and humidity measurements from the DHT20 temperature and humidity sensor.

### HCSR04
The HCSR04 library is used for operating the HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance measuring module, which can measure distances.

### IRsendRev
The IRsendRev library is likely used for sending infrared signals, commonly used for remote control devices or communicating with other infrared receivers.

### Servo
This library file is prepared for the servo to rotate. Without this file, the servo cannot be driven.

### TimerOne
The TimerOne library provides a simple API to access the timer functions on Arduino boards, specifically the functions of Timer1.

### LSM6DS3TR.h
The contents of this library file are specifically written for the LSM6DS3TR accelerometer sensor, according to its manual. With this library file, you can drive the accelerometer to operate.
