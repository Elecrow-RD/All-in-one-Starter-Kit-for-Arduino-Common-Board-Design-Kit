### AdafruitBusIO
AdafruitBusIO is a library for communicating with various hardware, providing support for buses such as I2C, SPI, and UART.

### AdafruitLiquidCrystal
The AdafruitLiquidCrystal library allows you to easily control liquid crystal displays (LCDs), commonly used for displaying text and other information.

### AdafruitMCP3008
The AdafruitMCP3008 library is used for interfacing with the MCP3008 analog-to-digital converter (ADC) module, which converts analog signals to digital values.

### AdafruitMCP23017ArduinoLibrary
This library enables Arduino to interact with the MCP23017 I/O expander chip, thereby adding additional GPIO pins.

### BH1750
The BH1750 library is used for reading data from the BH1750 ambient light sensor, which is a high-precision digital ambient light sensor.

### DHT20
The DHT20 library is used for obtaining temperature and humidity measurements from the DHT20 temperature and humidity sensor.

### DigitalLightSensor
The DigitalLightSensor library likely refers to any digital light intensity sensor interface, but the specific details depend on the actual sensor model used.

### HCSR04
The HCSR04 library is used for operating the HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance measuring module, which can measure distances.

### IRsendRev
The IRsendRev library is likely used for sending infrared signals, commonly used for remote control devices or communicating with other infrared receivers.

### MFRC522
The MFRC522 library is used for communicating with the MFRC522 RFID reader/writer card module, which can read and write 13.56MHz contactless IC cards.

### TimerOne
The TimerOne library provides a simple API to access the timer functions on Arduino boards, specifically the functions of Timer1.
